# Obsidian Smoosh

Ever tried the [Obsidian] random Doom level generator? Ever wish you could have MORE than 32 maps at once?
Introducing `smoosh.exe`! Give it as many wads as you want and it'll dumbly smash them together.

I do not guarantee that map progression works beyond MAP30 yet. I will have to write some code that generates a sensible MAPINFO, but that is easier said than done.
